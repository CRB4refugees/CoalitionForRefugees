# **Partnerships for Systems Change**

CRB is committed to engage in the collective action needed for true education systems change. Over the last 6 years, we have been integrally embedded in the work of educational collaborative efforts throughout King County. We see our role in community-wide efforts as a direct-service, education-focused organization and advocacy agency which occupies the intersection of newcomer communities and educational institutions.

## **K-12 Education Partners**

CRB has built strong, long-term partnerships with Seattle Public Schools (SPS) and Kent School District, establishing relationships with school district staff and Kent Meridian High School, Rainier Beach High School, and Seattle World School, three high schools with the highest LEP populations in King County.

## **Collaborative Partners**

We actively participate in cross-sector, collective impact consortiums in King County, working closely with partners such as the City of Kent, City of Seattle, Green River College, Seattle University Center for Community Engagement, Highline College, King County Public Health, Jewish Family Services, and Housing Development Consortium.

## **Community-Based Partners**

CRB participates in community partnerships and works alongside other Ethnic Community Based Organizations (ECBOs) such as Living Well Kent, Iraqi Womenâ€™s Association, Somali Youth and Family Club, Mother Africa, Iraqi Community Center of Washington, Community Network Council, and Centro Rendu to build capacity, empower community leaders, and coordinate services.
